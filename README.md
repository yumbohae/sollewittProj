On a black canvas, start at the top right and draw diverging white lines from the right to left. As you end on the left side of the canvas, double back at about 30 degrees back to the right and stop in the middle of the canvas. Repeat this with each white line slightly lower than the previous line. Finally, finish the canvas by creating a white rectangle on the bottom left corner.
