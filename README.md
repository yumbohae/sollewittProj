On a black canvas, start by drawing diverging white lines from the right to left, and as you end on the left side of the canvas, double back at about -30 degrees back to the right and stop at the middle. Repeat this with each white line slightly lower than the previous line. Finally, finish the canvas by creating a white rectangle on the bottom left corner.
